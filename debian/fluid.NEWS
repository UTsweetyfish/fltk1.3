fltk1.3 (1.3~r7710-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Per http://www.fltk.org/str.php?L2259, fluid no longer produces
  (empty) implementations for empty functions in .fl files.  You can
  override this behavior by arranging for their bodies to contain
  comments, either within fluid's GUI or by hand-editing the relevant
  portions of .fl files to read something along the lines of

  Function {foo()} {...
  } {
    comment {This body intentionally left blank.} {in_source not_in_header
    }
  }

  rather than

  Function {foo()} {...
  } {}

  Apologies for any resulting disruption.
